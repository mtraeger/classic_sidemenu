Old Menu
===========

Menu on the left side for [owncloud](http://owncloud.org/).

**This is a beta version. Please, try it on test server before.** (No reason to break anything, but we never know)

This app does the exact opposite of [menu on top](https://github.com/awikatchikaen/menu_on_top) by awikatchikaen, and
the exact opposite of the current behavior for owncloud 7.
When screen width is larger than 1100px, menu is placed to the left (like old oc menu). Smaller than 1100px, menu bring back
to the top.
